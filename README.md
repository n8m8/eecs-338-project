# eecs-338-project

This is the final pair project for Operating Systems and Concurrent programming, written in Java. It has a Server class that is run by itself, and several client classes that can be run which communicate with the server (locally--could be expanded to across a network) using Java's socket library. It uses multithreading to handle multiple requests simultaneously, and all clients have a terminal interface to do actions, you can type 'help' to see a list of commands.

*Requires Java 9*
